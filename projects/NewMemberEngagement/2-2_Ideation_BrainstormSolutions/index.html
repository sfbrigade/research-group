          <h3> Ideation: Solution Brainstorming </h3><br>
          <p><strong>In the ideation phase, we invited new members to participate in our open brainstorming sessions</strong> to generate as many ideas as possible to address the four challenges of new member engagement. We believe that the best way to come up with good ideas is to have many ideas to choose from. With this in mind, we selected ideas for implementation based on their importance and feasibility.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Here are the <strong>four challenges</strong> for open brainstorming sessions and the resulting implementations.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Challenge 1: How might we physically display hack night-related information, such as agenda and floor space, to reduce uncertainty? </strong></p>
          <p> First-time new members may feel anxious about the Hack Night, especially when combining with the uncertainty about the location, agenda, and the meeting space.</p>
          <p>To alleviate the anxiety that new members experience, <strong>we decided to design clear and lively signage</strong>, including a door sign, an agenda sign, and a floor map of the space, and communicate to the doorman about introducing the signage. The goal is to make Hack-Night-related information as visible to new members as possible, reduce uncertainty, and help new members feel more confident to step forward and participate.</p><br>

          <p><strong> Challenge 2: How might we make it easier for new members to approach project teams?</strong></p>
          <p>To make it easier for new members to find different project teams, we decided to implement <strong>a team shout-out </strong> at the orientation, and bring back the program where <strong>projects teams put up their names on a tall stand / table sign</strong>. This is intended to help new members, immediately after finishing orientation, navigate the open space and find different project teams more easily.</p>
          <p>To encourage conversations between new members and project teams without causing disruption to team productivity, we proposed a <strong>‘team ambassador program’</strong>.  The idea is that each project team would have a team ambassador wearing his/her name sticker on the upper arm, instead of the chest, on the Hack Night. New members should feel comfortable to approach team ambassadors, whose responsibility is to welcome new members and introduce them to the project.</p><br>


          <p><strong> Challenge 3: How might we provide critical project information and help new members identify project teams of interests?</strong></p>
          <p>We decided to implement <strong>‘team shout-out’</strong> at the Hack Night orientation, where each project lead spends 30 seconds describing their mission and project needs.</p>
          <p>We also aimed to <strong>improve the current project list</strong> in the Code For San Francisco website by including information that is critical for new members to identify fitting projects, and making the project list more user-friendly.</p><br>

          <p><strong> Challenge 4: How might we facilitate matching between new members and project teams based on shared interests and skills?</strong></p>
          <p>New members’ key frustrations are identifying a fitting project (among the 90 projects on the Code for SF website), and then contributing their skills effectively. At the same time, project teams have a hard time recruiting qualified individuals to carry the projects to the next level.</p>

          <div>
          <p>We decided to address the challenge with <strong>‘project team shout out' at the orientation, and building a Project Matching App to connect new members with project teams.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>‘Project team shout-out’</strong> not only provides new members a basic ideas of projects that are present at the Hack Night, but also facilitates the core team to personally guide new members to a potentially fitting project.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Matching App</strong> collects new members’ skills and interests without the constraint of the new members’ being at the hack night or the availability of the core team. It also <strong>generates a list of recommended projects</strong> based on the degree of matching with project teams. We envision that the Matching Hat app will reduce the time new members have to spend on finding a fitting project, serve as a conversation starter as new members reach out to the project teams, and help project teams find the members that they need.</li>
          </ul>
