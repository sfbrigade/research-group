# Welcome to the UX Research Group!

We are a working group at [Code for San Francisco](http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/). The UX Research Group applies user-centered design, design thinking methods, and lots of post-it notes to improve C4SF projects and the Brigade experience.

## How to get involved

All are welcome because UX research involves many different skills and skill levels! 

We convene at the [C4SF Civic Hack Night](http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/events/) on Wednesday evenings. You can also find us on the [#research slack channel](https://sfbrigade.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2Fresearch). Please reach out and we can talk about how you can get involved.

## Projects

### New Member Engagement

New member engagement is key to project success at Code for SF. To identify feasible and desirable areas of new member engagement improvements, the UX Research Group has conducted extensive user-centered design processes and gained initial success with physical, service, and digital prototypes, including signage, team accessibility program, project matching hat app, and web project list. The UX Research Group is in the process of turning our prototypes into full-scale implementations.

## Our Mission

Our working group exists to promote learning and mutual improvement among its members, while also providing support and advisory services for project teams and the Brigade as a whole. 

We believe this group is important because it helps reinforce user-centered design principles that are essential for the delivery of effective digital products and services.

## What we do in the community

We are an active group, and at any time you will find us working on a project together.

+ **Consultations** with C4SF project leads in order to uncover user needs, refocus project efforts, and improve the user experience of apps.
+ **Workshop facilitations** to learn together about the underlying principles of user-centered design.
+ **Targeted studies** to address selected community and brigade-level issues and challenges.
